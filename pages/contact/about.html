          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            I've been working in Tech since 1992 but I always had a passion for
            creating online projects from A to Z. I like to be involved in the
            entire project delivery process from talking to customers, assessing
            their situation, creating the design, developing the website,
            launching it and offering basic advices.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have more than 2 years of experience in creating company websites,
            blogs, landing pages, and right now I'm learning how to create
            online shops.
          </p>
          <p>
            Design: I like clean and modern design because it's usually the best
            way to convey the message to the target audience. Development: HTML,
            CSS, JS, NODE-JS are the frontend and backend languages I work with
            every day to create awesome projects.
